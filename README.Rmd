# OSMtools

R wrappers for [OSM Filter](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter) and [OSM Convert](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) and functions for downloading from [geofabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html). The package makes it easier to download and use large [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org)  files with R.

**Note**: The package is currently windows only

## Installation

Install the package with **remotes** as follows:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") # If you do not already have the remotes package
remotes::install_github("ITSleeds/OSMTools")
```

## Usage

This R package provides a userfiendly interface to the Windows command line tools osmfilter.exe and osmconvert.exe. For example, if you wanted to get the road in your local area.

You can download a section of the OSM for your local area from Geofabrik.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osmt_geofabrik_dl(region = "europe/great-britain/england/west-yorkshire", destfile = "wy.pbf")
```

Then convert the PBF file into a format that can be edited.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osmt_convert(file = "wy.pbf", format_out = "o5m")
```

Then make a new file with just the roads.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osmt_filter(file = "wy.o5m", path_out = "wy_roads.o5m", keep = "highway=")
```
